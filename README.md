# About

This repository contains the basic command lines to install composer, NodeJS, ... on a shared hosting.

I know that you can find these online easily but it's good to have them in 1 place



# How to run these commands

Login via SSH or any terminal solution to your shared hosting and then run the scripts in the attached files.

*NB: if you do not have access to the server via terminal but can install a PHP solution on the server, I recommend that you install something like this script: https://github.com/flozz/p0wny-shell*



# Available scripts

- Install NodeJS and NPM (taken from : https://convertcaffeineintocode.com/blogs/how-to-install-node-js-on-shared-hosting)

Run install-nodejs-npm.sh or copy paste the code inside it to your terminal then run **npm install -g npm** to update npm

- Install Composer

run install-composer.sh or copy paste the code inside it to your terminal
